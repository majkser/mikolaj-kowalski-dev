This was my first project involving data fetching, built using **React** and the **OMDb API**. The app allows users to search for specific movies, preview their details, read descriptions, check ratings, watch trailers, and even rate the movies themselves. User ratings are stored locally using **localStorage**, making it easy to keep track of your favorites.

The main page loads a selection of random movies from the top 200 best movies, making it a great starting point for discovering something new to watch. Whether you're looking for a blockbuster or a hidden gem, this app has you covered!

<InfoBox>
    Built with **React** and powered by the **OMDb API**, this project was my first experience with fetching and managing external data.

    It was a fun challenge to implement features like local storage for user ratings and random movie suggestions. While it‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs a great tool for movie enthusiasts looking for their next watch!
