This project was developed as part of my web techniques class during my computer science studies. It's a comprehensive hall reservation system built with **Node.js** and **Express**, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and book venue spaces.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Approach

<InfoBox>
    Built with **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend, **EJS** for templating, and **MySQL** as the database.

    This academic project gave me hands-on experience with full-stack development, from database design to server-side programming and frontend implementation. While relatively simple in scope, it effectively demonstrates core web application concepts like authentication, CRUD operations, and session management.
