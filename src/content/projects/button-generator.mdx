This was my first React project—a button generator that allows users to customize button properties and generate CSS classes or download a PNG image of the button. It's not perfect, but hey, even Picasso had to start somewhere, right? 🎨

## 🛠️ Development Approach

<InfoBox>
    Built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, this project marked my first foray into component-based development.

    While it’s far from perfect, it was a great learning experience. At least the buttons look good, even if the code could use a little... polish. Let's just say it's a "work in progress" that works!
