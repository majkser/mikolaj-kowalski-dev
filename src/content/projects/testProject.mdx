# Modern React Patterns for Scalable Applications

React has evolved significantly since its inception, and with it, many patterns have emerged to solve common challenges in building scalable applications.

## Compound Components

Compound components are a pattern where multiple components work together to form a cohesive API. This pattern is particularly useful for creating flexible UI components.

```jsx
<Menu>
  <MenuButton>Actions</MenuButton>
  <MenuList>
    <MenuItem>Download</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Create a Copy</MenuItem>
    <MenuItem>Delete</MenuItem>
  </MenuList>
</Menu>
```
