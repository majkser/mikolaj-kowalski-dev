This project is still in progress. currently, it allows users to create an account or log in via Gmail (OAuth2), browse/download the files that they have access to and also they can generate link so that users without an account can also download specific files. Users with admin status can send files to the server, grant admin to other users and grant or revoke file access to other users. The project is mostly done but it still lacks some styling issues and mobile app which is crucial for this kind of service.
