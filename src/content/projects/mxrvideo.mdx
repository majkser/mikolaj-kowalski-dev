This was one of my first web development projects - a simple portfolio website
showcasing photography and videography work.

## 🛠️ Development Approach

<InfoBox>
    Built with **vanilla JavaScript** as one of my very first web development projects.

    Looking back, I would approach this project completely differently now, using modern
    frameworks and development practices that I've since mastered. It serves as a reminder
    of my journey as a developer. At least it's easy to
    maintain—vanilla JavaScript never goes out of style (or gets outdated dependencies) 😆!
