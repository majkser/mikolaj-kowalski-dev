### Make your dev life simpler - one repo to rule them all

If you're juggling multiple apps, services, and shared libraries, you know the drill: dozens of repos, out-of-sync dependencies, and hundreds of PRs to bump one package version. A monorepo puts everything in one place and cuts most of these problems away.

### What is a Monorepo?

A monorepo stores all of your projects code (or some bigger fragment e.g. all frontend related code) in a single repository instead of a forest of separate repos (Polyrepo). That unified layout makes developers lives a lot easier.

### Why monorepos feel nicer to developers

Developers love the simplicity of a single workspace: everything is discoverable, you can run multiple apps locally with a single command, and changing a shared type or component is a simple edit instead of coordinating several PRs across repos. This reduces context switching and the "where is that code?" problem.

For bigger companies this also simplifies managing access to the code: you don't need to grant access to many tiny repos - grant access to the monorepo and new employees can work without repeated permission requests, saving a ton of time.

### Real wins for shared code, types and packages

Let's pretend that we have a full-stack TypeScript project (node.js as a backend and React/Angular/Vue as a frontend). In a monorepo you can keep `libs`, `types`, `utils` and other shared packages next to the apps that use them. That means:

- Shared TypeScript interfaces/types live in one place and are instantly used by frontend and backend.
- Shared libraries can be updated in one commit you don't have to bump a published package across many repos.

### Tooling matters - Nx

A good monorepo is more than folders: tools like [Nx](https://nx.dev) build a dependency graph, run only the affected tasks, and cache results so builds/serves/tests are fast and CI cost is low. That's how monorepos should scale without turning into a slow and messy code base.

### Use pnpm (JS/TS projects)

For large monorepos, prefer [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) over npm: it uses a global content-addressable store and symlinked node_modules, saving disk and install time. This change can make your packages install **3 times faster**. For big repositories that translates directly into saved minutes.

### Monorepo even for small teams

Monorepos aren't only for huge orgs. Small teams and solo full-stack devs can benefit from them e.g. When backend and frontend share same programming language (JS/TS). You get consistent tooling, one place for types, and immediate cross-project refactors - often simplifying daily work more than it complicates it.

### When to be cautious

Monorepos are powerful, but not zero cost. Avoid them if:

- Projects are utterly independent with separate lifecycles
- You won't invest in CI caching and tooling — without that, the repo can get slow
- You don't have clear ownership rules and dependency boundaries so "everyone can edit everything"

### Quick summary

If you want faster cross-team refactors, simpler sharing of packages, fewer permission headaches in large orgs, and a nicer day-to-day developer experience, a monorepo is an excellent choice. Pair it with workspace-aware tooling (Nx/turborepo) and pnpm and you won't regret it.
